# Computational Geometry Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various computational geometry algorithms in Java. [Main.java](https://github.com/fsaltunyuva/ComputationalGeometryAlgorithms/blob/main/src/Main.java) contains some example usages of these algorithms.

Currently implemented algorithms include:
- [Primitive Algorithms](https://github.com/fsaltunyuva/ComputationalGeometryAlgorithms/blob/main/src/PrimitiveAlgorithms.java)
    - Line-Line Intersection
    - Segment-Segment Intersection
    - Point-Line Distance
    - Disk-Disk Intersection
    - Triangle-Triangle Intersection
    - Orientation Test
    - Is Point in Triangle
